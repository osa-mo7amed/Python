#This program is answer to: Even or Odd Checker
#Write a function that takes a number and prints whether it is even or odd.
#Use a loop to test it on numbers from 1 to 20.

#This program is answer to:Multiplication Table
#Write a function that prints the multiplication table (1–10) for any number entered by the user.
#Example: if user enters 5, output 5 x 1 = 5 … 5 x 10 = 50.
